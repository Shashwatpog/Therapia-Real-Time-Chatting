# SASEhacks 2023 - Therapia App 
Therapia is a journaling app that allows users to journal with AI based prompts
The AI model then parses through the user's journal entry and recommends them groups and communities to join with similar individuals
It also suggests activities for self care based on journal entry.

I worked on the real time chatting feature of the app for the communities and groupchat tab of the app.

**Real-Time Chat Feature with Flask API**
- Developed a real-time chat application with a Flask API responsible for user registration, authentication, message storage, and real-time communication.
- Technologies used : Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, RESTful API design
- Designed and implemented RESTful API endpoints for user registration, authentication, and real-time messaging.
- Ensured robust security measures, including user authentication and authorization.
- Integrated the API with a database to store and retrieve messages.
